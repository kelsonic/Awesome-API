# Awesome API 🙌

This is a barebones node/express API with users/clients already set up with JWT. ⚡️

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
1. Populate `.env` based on [.env.example](./.env.example) (ensure `DATABASE_URL` is populated with your own remote db).
1. `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. `npx prisma migrate dev` to run the migrations.
1. `yarn start:dev` and your server will now be running on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)! 🚀
